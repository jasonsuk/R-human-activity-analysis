## Data analysis roadmap

### 1. Ask
Sršen, the cofounder and Chief Create Officier of Beallbeat, asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. She then wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation. These questions will guide your analysis:

  1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
  2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
  3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

#### Deliverables:
  1. A clear summary of the business task
  2. A description of all data sources used
  3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
  4. A summary of your analysis
  5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
  6. Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis

#### Guiding questions:
  - What is the problem to be solved?
  - What metrics to measure?
  - Who is the stakeholder and audience?
  - How relevant this project is to the stakeholders for their decisions?


### 2. Prepare
The publicly available data of non-Bellabeat smart devices will be used. [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) represents personal fitness tracker from 30 fitbit users. It includes information about daily activity, steps and heart rate to explore users' habits. In case that the data is limited, it is always encouraged to add another data.

#### Guiding questions:
  - Is data ROCCC (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current and Cited)?
  - Where is the data located and how is it organized?
  - Is there any need to consider licensing, privacy, security and accessibility issues?
  
  
### 3. Process

  - Which tool to use?
  - What steps to take to ensure data is clean and ready to analyze?
  - Is the cleaning process documented for review and communication with others?
  
### 4. Analyze
  - What trends and relationships found in the data
  - What surprises discovered from the data?
  - Do the insights answer the business question and solve the problem?

### 5. Share
  - What story does the data tell?
  - How do the findings relate to the original question?
  - Who is the audience again and what is the best way to communicate with them?
  - Can data visualization help share the findings?
  - Is the presentation accessible to the audience?

### 6. Act  
  - What is the final conclusion based on the analysis?
  - How can the audience/stakeholder apply the insights?
  - What are the next steps that stakeholders can take?
  - Is there additional data to expand on the findings?
